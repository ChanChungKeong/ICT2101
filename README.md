# Active Mobility Safety 

Active Mobility Safety (AMS) VR educates safe riding practices to cyclists and personal mobility device (PMD) users on Singapore roads, walkways and shared paths through a VR experience. It allows pedestrians who have not ride before to experience what these riders encounter on the roads from day to day. This document is to guide new players and administrative SCTF members to access their respective system.

## Project Framework
aFrame is a web framework that is used for this project to build on the virtual reality (VR) experience. It is based on top of HTML and accessible by a web/mobile browser application. Mobile devices which supports VR will be able to use headsets such as google cardboard to play the game.
